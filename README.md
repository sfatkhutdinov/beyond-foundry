# Beyond Foundry

> **Note:** This is the **main and canonical repository** for Beyond Foundry. All development, issues, and releases are tracked here.
> 
> **Repository Status:**
> - ‚úÖ **Directory organization complete** (June 10, 2025)
> - ‚úÖ All test files moved to `tests/manual/` and `tests/debug/`
> - ‚úÖ Sample data organized in `data/samples/`
> - ‚úÖ Documentation structured in `docs/analysis/` and `docs/fixes/`

> - **IMPORTANT:** The main branch is protected on GitHub. If you need to remove large files from history, you must temporarily disable branch protection to allow a force-push, or contact GitHub support for assistance. See NEXT_STEPS.md for details.
> - To prevent future issues, ensure `.gitignore` excludes all large binary files and archives (see below).

## 2025-06-12: Class Importer & Proxy Directory Overhaul

- **Class Importer Overhaul:**
  - The class importer now robustly parses D&D Beyond class HTML, extracting all core traits, features, progression tables, and subclasses with high fidelity.
  - Extraction logic is tightly coupled to the actual HTML structure, ensuring reliable and future-proof imports.
  - All outputs are now clean, canonical JSON‚Äî**no raw HTML is included in the output** (the `rawHtml` debug field has been removed).
  - Subclass, feature, and progression extraction is now complete and type-safe.
- **Proxy Directory Fix:**
  - The `beyond-foundry-proxy` directory is now a regular, fully tracked directory in the main repository (not a broken submodule).
  - All proxy code, including `src/class.ts`, is now versioned and tracked with the main repo, ensuring all updates are visible and shareable.
  - Developers should now update, commit, and push changes to proxy code as with any other part of the repo.
- **Recommended Workflow:**
  - Make changes to proxy code in `beyond-foundry-proxy/` as needed.
  - Rebuild the Docker container and test endpoints after any parser or proxy update.
  - All changes will be tracked and versioned by git, and can be reviewed in PRs or via `git log`.

Beyond Foundry is a FoundryVTT module that imports your purchased D&D Beyond content. This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, development status, and setup instructions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Large File Handling & .gitignore

- All large files (e.g., FoundryVTT zips, cache, binaries) **must not** be committed to git. Use `.gitignore` to exclude them.
- If a large file is accidentally committed, follow the instructions in NEXT_STEPS.md to remove it from history.
- Consider using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for any required large assets.

## ‚ú® Canonical Spell Compendium Linking & Bulk Import

Beyond Foundry now uses a canonical compendium for all spells:
- When importing a character, spells are linked to a single compendium entry (by DDB ID or name) instead of creating duplicate embedded items.
- You can bulk import all D&D Beyond spells into a compendium for fast, consistent spell access.
- The character import workflow will reference compendium spells where possible, falling back to embedded items only if a compendium entry is missing.

### How to Bulk Import Spells to a Compendium

**Note**: This feature requires a valid Cobalt session token.

1. Open the FoundryVTT console (F12).
2. Run:
   ```javascript
   // Replace with your actual cobalt token and compendium name
   const cobaltToken = "your_cobalt_session_token_here";
   await game.modules.get("beyond-foundry").api.bulkImportSpellsToCompendium(cobaltToken, "beyondfoundry.spells");
   ```
3. Wait for the import to complete. All D&D Beyond spells will be available in the compendium.

**Important**: You must provide your D&D Beyond Cobalt session token as the first parameter.

### How Character Spell Import Works Now
- When importing a character, Beyond Foundry checks the compendium for each spell (by DDB ID or name).
- If found, the actor is linked to the compendium spell (no duplicate embedded item is created).
- If not found, the spell is imported as an embedded item (rare).
- This ensures all spells reference a single, canonical source.

### Developer Notes
- The compendium workflow uses dynamic Foundry API access (`as any`) for compatibility with v10/v11+.
- See `src/module/api/BeyondFoundryAPI.ts` for implementation details.

## üõ°Ô∏è Canonical Item Compendium Linking & Bulk Import

Beyond Foundry now uses a canonical compendium for all items, mirroring the spell import system:
- When importing a character, items are linked to a single compendium entry (by DDB ID) instead of creating duplicate embedded items.
- You can bulk import all D&D Beyond items into a compendium for fast, consistent item access.
- The character import workflow will reference compendium items where possible, falling back to embedded items only if a compendium entry is missing.
- All imported items must include `flags['beyond-foundry'].ddbId` for compendium matching and linking.

### How to Bulk Import Items to a Compendium

**Note**: This feature requires a valid Cobalt session token.

1. Open the FoundryVTT console (F12).
2. Run:
   ```javascript
   // Replace with your actual cobalt token and compendium name
   const cobaltToken = "your_cobalt_session_token_here";
   await game.modules.get("beyond-foundry").api.bulkImportItemsToCompendium(cobaltToken, "beyondfoundry.items");
   ```
3. Wait for the import to complete. All D&D Beyond items will be available in the compendium.

**Important**: You must provide your D&D Beyond Cobalt session token as the first parameter.

### How Character Item Import Works Now
- When importing a character, Beyond Foundry checks the compendium for each item (by DDB ID).
- If found, the actor is linked to the compendium item (no duplicate embedded item is created).
- If not found, the item is imported as an embedded item (rare).
- This ensures all items reference a single, canonical source.

### Developer Notes
- The compendium workflow uses dynamic Foundry API access (`as any`) for compatibility with v10/v11+.
- See `src/module/api/BeyondFoundryAPI.ts` for implementation details, including the new `bulkImportItemsToCompendium` and `addItemsToActor` helpers.
- The canonical item structure for FoundryVTT is more detailed than the analysis output and must include all required fields for compendium linking and Foundry integration.
- The analysis output (e.g., `comprehensive-analysis-*.json`) is for debugging/validation and is intentionally simpler than the final import structure.

## üê≥ Docker/Proxy Authentication: Baking in Your Cobalt Cookie

For local development and terminal-based testing, you can bake your D&D Beyond Cobalt cookie into the proxy Docker container. This allows you to test endpoints without passing the token in every request.

### How to Use

1. **Set the `COBALT_COOKIE` environment variable** when running the proxy container. You can do this in two ways:

   - **Via `.env` file** (recommended for local dev):
     1. Create a file named `.env` in the `beyond-foundry-proxy/` directory (or project root).
     2. Add this line (replace with your actual token):
        ```env
        COBALT_COOKIE=your_cobalt_session_token_here
        ```
     3. The `docker-compose.yml` is already configured to load this variable.

   - **Via shell environment variable**:
     ```sh
     export COBALT_COOKIE=your_cobalt_session_token_here
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

2. **Restart the proxy container** after setting the variable:
   ```sh
   docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Test endpoints** without passing a token in the body:
   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/proxy/auth
   ```
   If the cookie is set, you should get a success response.

**Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or Cobalt token to version control. `.env` is already in `.gitignore`.
