## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. **Repository Settings**
```bash
# Run the setup script to configure GitHub features
./.github/setup-github-features.sh
```

### 2. **Required Secrets**
Add these secrets in your repository settings:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Code coverage reporting
- `SONAR_TOKEN`: Code quality analysis
