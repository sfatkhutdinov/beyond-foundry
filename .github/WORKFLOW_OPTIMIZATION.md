# GitHub Workflow Optimization Recommendations

## Current Status: âœ… WELL CONFIGURED

Your GitHub setup is actually **excellent** and follows enterprise-level best practices. However, as a solo developer, you may want to consider simplifying some workflows to reduce noise.

## Core Workflows (Keep These) âœ…

### Essential for FoundryVTT Module Development:
- **`ci.yml`** - Build, test, lint (CRITICAL)
- **`auto-create-issues.yml`** - TODO/FIXME automation (VALUABLE)
- **`auto-release.yml`** - Release automation (TIME-SAVING)
- **`security.yml`** - Security scanning (IMPORTANT)
- **`pr-todo-detection.yml`** - PR TODO detection (QUALITY)

## Optional Workflows (Consider Disabling)

### For Solo Development:
- **`project-management.yml`** - Project board automation
  - *Disable if*: You don't use GitHub project boards
  - *Action*: Rename to `.project-management.yml.disabled`

- **`nightly.yml`** - Nightly builds  
  - *Disable if*: Builds are fast and you prefer on-demand
  - *Action*: Rename to `.nightly.yml.disabled`

- **`coverage.yml`** - Coverage reporting
  - *Disable if*: CI already runs tests and you don't need detailed coverage
  - *Action*: Merge coverage into `ci.yml` or disable

- **`community.yml`** - Community health checks
  - *Keep if*: You want automated community file validation
  - *Disable if*: You manually maintain community files

## How to Disable Workflows

```bash
# Option 1: Rename to disable (keeps history)
mv .github/workflows/nightly.yml .github/workflows/.nightly.yml.disabled

# Option 2: Delete (if you're sure you don't need them)
rm .github/workflows/project-management.yml
```

## Recommended Minimal Setup for Solo Developer

```
.github/workflows/
â”œâ”€â”€ ci.yml                    # Build, test, lint, type-check
â”œâ”€â”€ auto-create-issues.yml    # TODO automation  
â”œâ”€â”€ auto-release.yml          # Release automation
â”œâ”€â”€ security.yml              # Security scanning
â””â”€â”€ pr-todo-detection.yml     # PR quality check
```

## Your Current Setup Rating: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

- **Professional Grade**: Enterprise-level DevOps practices
- **Automation**: Excellent TODO/FIXME tracking
