   ```

2. **Configure Branch Protection** (recommended):
   - Visit: https://github.com/sfatkhutdinov/beyond-foundry/settings/branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch: require PR reviews, status checks
   
3. **Set up Codecov** (for detailed coverage reports):
   ```bash
   # Sign up at codecov.io, import repository
   gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN --body "YOUR_CODECOV_TOKEN"
   ```
