# Security Update Notice

## Docker Compose Security Enhancement

**Date**: December 2024  
**Issue**: Sensitive FoundryVTT credentials were exposed in `docker-compose.yml`  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

### Changes Made

1. **Moved sensitive data to environment variables**
   - Created `.env` file for credentials (ignored by git)
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use environment variables
   - Created `.env.example` template for setup

2. **Enhanced security measures**
   - `docker-compose.yml` remains in `.gitignore` (already configured)
   - `.env` file properly ignored by git
   - Created `docker-compose.template.yml` for reference

3. **Added documentation**
   - Created comprehensive `docs/DOCKER_SETUP.md` guide
   - Includes security best practices
   - Provides troubleshooting steps

### Files Created/Modified

```
✅ .env                        (new, contains actual credentials)
✅ .env.example                (new, template for others)
✅ docker-compose.template.yml (new, reference template)
✅ docker-compose.yml          (updated to use env vars)
✅ docs/DOCKER_SETUP.md        (new, comprehensive guide)
```

### Security Verification

- ✅ No sensitive data in git history
- ✅ Current docker-compose.yml uses environment variables
- ✅ `.env` file properly ignored by git
- ✅ Template files available for setup guidance

### For New Contributors

Follow the setup guide in `docs/DOCKER_SETUP.md` to configure your environment securely:

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your FoundryVTT credentials
nano .env

# Copy docker-compose template if needed
cp docker-compose.template.yml docker-compose.yml

# Start services
docker-compose up -d
```

### Next Steps

The immediate security issue has been resolved. The project can now proceed with:
- Setting up remaining GitHub integrations
- Configuring branch protection rules
- Testing the automation workflows

All sensitive credentials are now properly secured and isolated from version control.
