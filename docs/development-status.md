## üèÅ What Works Now

- Character import (all levels, classes, races, backgrounds)
- Spell import (all spellcasting classes, multiclass, advanced parsing)
- Proxy authentication (cobalt token, Docker, multi-user)
- Import and authentication dialogs (FoundryVTT UI)
- TypeScript strict mode, modern build system
- Integration and diagnostic scripts
- Bulk spell import and canonical compendium linking
- Robust endpoint implementation and error handling
- Docker-based deployment and testing
- **Basic equipment/item import** (advanced features planned)
- **Class Importer Overhaul**: Robust HTML parsing, complete feature/subclass/progression extraction, no raw HTML in output
- **Proxy Directory Fix**: beyond-foundry-proxy is now a regular, fully tracked directory in the main repository

## üõ†Ô∏è In Progress / Next Steps

- Equipment and item import improvements (attunement, containers, homebrew)
- Bulk character import and compendium support (planned)
- Advanced features: auto-sync, batch import, selective import, asset management (planned)
- Performance benchmarking and optimization docs (planned)
- Homebrew support documentation (planned)
- Compendium management tools and docs (planned)
- API reference documentation (planned)
- UI polish, screenshots, and walkthroughs (planned)
- User feedback enhancements
- **Further enhancements to class importer**: Additional subclass features, advanced progression tables, and integration with FoundryVTT class schema

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- See [FOUNDRY_TESTING.md](FOUNDRY_TESTING.md) for integration testing
- Use `npm run build:watch` for development
- Use diagnostic/test scripts in `scripts/` for parser and proxy validation
- All endpoints tested for robust error handling and data integrity
