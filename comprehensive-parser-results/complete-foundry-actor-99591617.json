Once per day, you can gain blindsight out to 30 feet for 5 minutes.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Dragon Tongue.</strong></em> You can speak and understand Draconic.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\r\n<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>"

          "backstory": "You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the greatest experts on the subjects that interest you. Your efforts have made you a master researcher. Stray was born in a secluded village on the outskirts of Alagaesia, nestled between the territories of the Elves and the Urgals. As a Tiefling, he was considered an outcast due to a dark and ancient pact made by his ancestors with a powerful fiend. Despite his heritage, Stray was always fascinated by the rich history and mysteries surrounding the lands of Alagaesia.\n\nAs a child, Stray stumbled upon an ancient, hidden library in the forest, filled with books and scrolls written in Elvish and Giant. He spent years teaching himself the languages and absorbing the knowledge contained within the library. The tales of the Elves' arrival and the unknown tragedy that drove them from Alalea captivated him, fueling his insatiable curiosity to unearth the lost secrets of the past.\n\nStray's thirst for knowledge eventually caught the attention of his otherworldly patron, The Fiend. The dark entity offered him a deal: limitless knowledge and power in exchange for his soul. Tempted by the prospect of unlocking the ancient mysteries of Alalea, Stray agreed to the pact and, in turn, received the Pact of the Tome. The pact granted him access to an ever-expanding grimoire containing spells and secrets throughout the ages.\n\nAs a sage, Stray set out to unravel the enigma of the Elves and the Urgals, driven by his belief that knowledge is the ultimate path to power and self-improvement. Despite his chaotic neutral nature, he vowed to perform great deeds to win back his soul from The Fiend. However, his obsession with uncovering the lost secrets of Alalea clouded his judgment, making him willing to risk entire civilizations in his quest for knowledge.\n\nStray's journey led him across Alagaesia, forging alliances and making enemies along the way. He became known as a mysterious figure, constantly wary of those who might steal his hard-earned secrets. His pact with The Fiend, the knowledge he gained, and the secrets he uncovered would ultimately shape the fate of Alagaesia and its residents.\n",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\r\n<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>",

Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature's game statistics).</p>\r\n<p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.</p>",

A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.</p>\r\n<p>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.</p>",
